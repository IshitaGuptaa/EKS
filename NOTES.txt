I AM USING RHEL 7.5 for my work

STEP1:  Create AWS account, then from root account(default) make one user profile , give admin property or give it eksclusterPolicy, save the credentials. 
STEP2: aws-cli download 
	command: curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"
 
	command: unzip awscli-bundle.zip

	command: sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws

	command: sudo /usr/local/bin/python3.7 awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
	
	command: aws --version (Check once)

 
STEP3: aws configure , Enter Access key, private key and region as is mentined in the cred file, we saved.
STEP4: for eks we can either use aws eks, but it is very tedious to handle. We have another alternate present that provides better functionality, ease and more advance features viz "eksctl"
	
	command: curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp

	command: sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin

	command: eksctl version (Check once)

STEP5: apply cluster.yml, this will call cloud formation in backgroud (teraform like AWS feature), 
 	
	command: eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yml

// To store the output in a file for later reference we can also use tee command
	command: eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yml | tee output.txt

STEP5:
